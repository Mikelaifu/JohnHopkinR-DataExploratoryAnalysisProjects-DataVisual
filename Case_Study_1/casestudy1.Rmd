Project 1
------------------------------

## project introduction

It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal movement using activity monitoring devices such as a Fitbit, Nike Fuelband, or Jawbone Up. These type of devices are part of the “quantified self” movement – a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for processing and interpreting the data.

This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.


**Dataset**

The variables included in this dataset are:

steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as \color{red}{\verb|NA|}NA)
date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken
The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there are a total of 17,568 observations in this dataset.

2. write your report into a Rmarkdown and knitter
3. submit your report into Github, submit a link to you github repository
4. then we need to submit a SHA-1 hash that indicate the specific commit that corresponds to the state of your repository that identifies your submission, that way the reviewer will know which version of submission can be looked at (state which commit is pointing to offical submission for this assignment) 

**Analysis Instruction**
- Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
- Mean and median number of steps taken each day
- Time series plot of the average number of steps taken
- The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps
- Code to describe and show a strategy for imputing missing data
- Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed
- Panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends
- All of the R code needed to reproduce the results (numbers, plots, etc.) in the report

Instruction of submission: 

1. got to your github repository, we need URL of the repositiory
2. to find your SHA-1 Hash: ![where to find Sha-1 Hash](Sha-1_Hash.png), then click into the abbre-version SHA-1 Hash Number, wec can see the full SHA-1 Hash number : ![full sha-1 hash page](Full_SHA-1_Hash.png),  now we can copy the specific SHA-1 Hash number.
3. inside the Full sha-1 hash page, we can see the full history of all the commit, we can click into the history commit to view the past snapshots of files or code before we commit the new stuff into our githubs

Analysis 
---------------------------------

### Step 1 Load and PPC Data

**impute missing values**

1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with \color{red}{\verb|NA|}NAs) 
2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc. 
3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

### Data Cleaning & PPC

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include = FALSE}

library(magrittr)
library(tidyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)

```


```{r  cache=TRUE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include = FALSE}
df_raw <- read_csv("Data/activity.csv")
```

```{r  cache=TRUE}
head(df_raw)
```

```{r  cache=TRUE}
summary(df_raw)
```

```{r  cache=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include = FALSE}
# count total # of rows 
sum(is.na(df_raw))
# count each columns are na value:  looks like na exist in steps columns
df_raw %>% sapply(., function(y) sum(length(which(is.na(y)))))
# impute the missing data with mean value of steps
mean_step <- mean(df_raw$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
# ?replace
replace_na_mean <- function(x) {
  replace(x, is.na(x), mean_step)
}
df_ppc <- df_raw %>% replace_na_mean %>% mutate(weekdays = weekdays(.$date))
# sum(is.na(df_ppc)) # has zero na value 
head(df_ppc)

df_step_daily <- df_ppc %>% 
  group_by(.$date) %>% 
  summarise(sum.steps = sum(steps), mean.steps = mean(steps) ) 

mean_steps_day <- mean(df_step_daily$sum.steps)
median_steps_day <- median(df_step_daily$sum.steps)
```
The median step among date is `r median_steps_day`, The mean step among date is `r mean_steps_day`

### Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed
```{r echo = TRUE, cache=TRUE}

# plot a bar to display sum of steps per day
df_ppc %>% ggplot(aes( x=date, y=steps )) + 
  geom_bar(position="dodge", stat="identity")

```

```{r echo = TRUE, cache=TRUE}

# histogram 
df_step_daily %>% ggplot(aes(x = sum.steps)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 2000)
```

### Average Activity Pattern

1. Time series plot of the average number of steps taken

```{r  cache=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include = FALSE}
df_step_interval <-  df_ppc %>% 
  mutate(weekdays = weekdays(.$date)) %>%
  group_by(interval) %>% 
  summarize(mean.step.interval = mean(steps) )
```

```{r echo = TRUE, cache=TRUE}
df_step_interval %>% ggplot(aes(x=interval, y=mean.step.interval)) + geom_line()
```

2. are there different activity pattern between weekdays and weekends?

```{r  cache=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include = FALSE}
df_step_interval_weekname <-  df_ppc %>%
  group_by(interval, date, weekdays) %>% 
  summarize(mean.step.interval =  mean(steps) ) %>%
  mutate(date_type = ifelse(weekdays %in% c("Saturday","Sunday"), "weekday", "weekend"))
```


```{r echo = TRUE, cache=TRUE}
df_step_interval_weekname %>% ggplot(aes(x=interval, y=mean.step.interval), color = date_type) + facet_grid(date_type~.) + geom_line() 

```



## To submit the assignment:

Commit your completed \color{red}{\verb|PA1_template.Rmd|}PA1_template.Rmd file to the \color{red}{\verb|master|}master branch of your git repository (you should already be on the \color{red}{\verb|master|}master branch unless you created new ones)
Commit your PA1_template.md and PA1_template.html files produced by processing your R markdown file with knit2html() function in R (from the knitr package) by running the function from the console.
If your document has figures included (it should) then they should have been placed in the figure/ directory by default (unless you overrided the default). Add and commit the figure/ directory to your git repository so that the figures appear in the markdown file when it displays on github.
Push your \color{red}{\verb|master|}master branch to GitHub.
Submit the URL to your GitHub repository for this assignment on the course web site.
In addition to submitting the URL for your GitHub repository, you will need to submit the 40 character SHA-1 hash (as string of numbers from 0-9 and letters from a-f) that identifies the repository commit that contains the version of the files you want to submit. You can do this in GitHub by doing the following

Going to your GitHub repository web page for this assignment
Click on the “?? commits” link where ?? is the number of commits you have in the repository. For example, if you made a total of 10 commits to this repository, the link should say “10 commits”.
You will see a list of commits that you have made to this repository. The most recent commit is at the very top. If this represents the version of the files you want to submit, then just click the “copy to clipboard” button on the right hand side that should appear when you hover over the SHA-1 hash. Paste this SHA-1 hash into the course web site when you submit your assignment. If you don't want to use the most recent commit, then go down and find the commit you want and copy the SHA-1 hash.
